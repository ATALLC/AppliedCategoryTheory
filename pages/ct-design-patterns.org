To this old software guy, category theory offers natural design patterns.
By "natural" I mean that they arise as reasoned consequences of assumptions.
In software, engineers have used design patterns to think about and communicate
ways to build code to solve problems.

Seasoned programmers can recognize patterns in systems code that aren't always
readily expressed by the programming languages. They're like the ghost in the
machine that you sense is there.  Even languages like Haskell that try
to make the ghosts be first-class citizens can't fully reveal them.
