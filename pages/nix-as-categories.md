# Nix through a categorical lens

I'll explain this topic by drawing on category theory's elegant abstractions,
but I'll keep things grounded for an experienced programmer like you—who's
likely familiar with functional programming concepts in languages like Haskell
or Scala, but not deep into the math. We'll use simple analogies (think: types
as "worlds," functions as "bridges" between them) to make it accessible. I'll
avoid heavy formalism and focus on intuition, while pointing to references
matched to your level for deeper dives.

### Quick Primer on Category Theory for Programmers
Category theory is like a high-level map of how structures (like data types or systems) connect and transform. Imagine it as a graph where:
- **Objects** are like "worlds" or types (e.g., the world of integers or the world of lists).
- **Morphisms** (arrows) are like functions or transformations that connect these worlds (e.g., a function that adds 1 to an integer, bridging "Int" to "Int").
- A **category** is the whole graph: objects plus morphisms, with rules like composition (chaining arrows) and identity (a "do-nothing" arrow for each object).

**Functors** are like "world translators": they map one category to another, preserving the structure. For example, in programming, the "List" functor takes a type (like Int) and turns it into List, and it maps functions (like "add 1") to work on lists (like mapping over the list).

**Natural transformations** are like "consistent upgrades" between functors: they provide a way to transform the output of one functor into another's, in a way that works uniformly across all objects and respects the morphisms.

This might sound abstract, but it's powerful for modeling systems like programming languages. A great analogy is how Git branches (worlds) connect via merges (morphisms), and tools like rebasing act like functors.[1][2]

### Nix's Model: Pure Evaluation vs. Side-Effectful Builds
Nix is a functional package manager that builds software reproducibly. It separates "thinking" (pure computation) from "doing" (side effects like writing files). Here's how it works:

- **Pure evaluation**: You write Nix expressions (like functions) that describe what to build. This phase is pure and lazy—it computes a "derivation" (a blueprint, like a JSON-like spec of inputs, outputs, and build steps) without touching the filesystem or network. It's deterministic: same inputs always yield the same derivation.[3][4]
- **Derivations and builds**: Once you have a derivation (e.g., a .drv file), Nix "instantiates" it by running the build in a sandbox. This is where side effects happen: fetching sources, compiling, and producing files in the Nix store (e.g., /nix/store/...). Builds are isolated and hash-based for reproducibility, but they're impure because they involve real-world actions like I/O.[4][5]

Analogy: Think of pure evaluation as planning a road trip on a map (no gas burned, no traffic), while the build is driving the car (fuel consumed, weather affects you). Nix ensures the plan is computed purely first, then executed with effects minimized and tracked.[5]

### Connecting Nix to Category Theory
Nix doesn't explicitly use category theory in its implementation (it's more of a functional programming tool), but we can model its design categorically. This is an interpretive lens—similar to how programmers model effects in Haskell. Let's break it down per your questions.

#### What Categories Are Involved?
We can think of two main categories here:
- **Category of Pure Nix Expressions (let's call it Expr)**: Objects are Nix values (e.g., strings, attrs like { foo = 42; }, or functions). Morphisms are pure functions that transform these (e.g., a function that takes an attrset and adds a key). This is like the "pure functional world" in programming—everything is composable and side-effect-free.[6]
- **Category of Builds/Derivations (let's call it Build)**: Objects are derivations or store paths (e.g., hashed outputs like /nix/store/abc-foo-1.0). Morphisms are build processes that transform inputs to outputs, but with side effects (e.g., compiling source code). This is the "effectful world".[4][5]

Analogy: Expr is like a clean whiteboard for sketching algorithms (no mess), while Build is like a workshop where you actually hammer nails (things get dirty).[7]

There's also a broader "functor category" implicitly, where functors map between these, but Nix itself isn't framed this way—it's more of an analogy to functional programming patterns.[2][6]

#### What Functors Exist Between Those Categories?
Functors bridge these categories:
- **Evaluation Functor (Expr → Build)**: This maps pure expressions to derivations. For example, it takes a Nix function describing a package and produces a .drv file. It preserves structure: if you compose pure functions in Expr, the functor ensures the resulting derivation respects that composition.[3][4]
- **Realization Functor (Build → Expr? Wait, not quite)**: Builds produce paths that can be referenced back in pure expressions (e.g., importing a built package). But it's not a full functor because builds are effectful and not purely composable. Instead, think of a "lift" functor that embeds pure values into the effectful world, similar to how functors in programming lift pure functions to work on containers.[1][2]

Analogy: Like the "map" function in programming (a functor) that applies a pure function to every item in a list, transforming the "world of singles" to the "world of lists" without losing structure.[2][7]

#### What Natural Transformations Are Induced by Pairs of Those Functors?
Natural transformations arise when you have two functors and need a "morphism between them" that works consistently. In Nix:
- Consider two functors from Expr to Build: one for "normal" evaluation and another for "cached" evaluation (Nix caches results to avoid recomputing). A natural transformation could be the "cache lookup": it transforms the output of the normal functor (a fresh derivation) to the cached one, ensuring that for any pure expression, the transformation commutes with morphisms (e.g., if you compose expressions, the cache respects that).[8][1][4]
- More generally, pairs like (Evaluation Functor + Identity Functor) induce transformations that "inject" pure values into derivations naturally.

Analogy: Imagine two ways to resize images (functors): one crops, one scales. A natural transformation is a "converter" that turns cropped images into scaled ones consistently, no matter the input image's shape—it always preserves proportions.[8][1]

These are induced because Nix's purity ensures transformations are uniform across expressions.[6]

#### How Does Nix Separate Pure Evaluations and Derivations from Side Effects? How Is This Like Monads?
Nix's separation is its killer feature for reproducibility: pure evaluation computes *what* to do (derivations) without effects, then hands off to the builder for *how* (with effects like file I/O). Derivations act as an intermediate layer—purely derived, but triggering effects when realized.[5][4]

This is strikingly like **monads** in category theory and programming. A monad is a functor with extra structure (unit and join operations) that lets you sequence computations while handling "effects" (like state or I/O) in a pure way.[9][7]
- **Unit/Return**: Like wrapping a pure value into a monadic context (e.g., Haskell's `return x` puts x into IO).
- **Bind/Join**: Chains effectful steps (e.g., `>>=` sequences IO actions).
- Monads keep the core logic pure but "contain" effects, ensuring they're composable.

In Nix: Pure evaluation is like the pure part of a monad (computing values), while builds are the "unwrapping" that performs effects. Derivations are like monadic values—blueprints that encapsulate potential effects without executing them yet. Composing Nix expressions is like monadic bind: you chain pure descriptions, and effects only happen at the end (when you "run" the monad, like building).[10][11][12][9]

Analogy: The IO monad in Haskell is like a "recipe" for I/O—you build a pure description of actions (e.g., `readFile >>= writeFile`), but nothing happens until the runtime executes it. Nix does the same: your expressions build a pure recipe (derivation), and the Nix daemon executes it with effects isolated. Just as monads prevent "effect leakage" in pure code, Nix prevents build impurities from tainting evaluation.[12][7][10]

If you've used promises or futures in JavaScript, that's a lightweight monad analogy—delaying effects until resolution.
