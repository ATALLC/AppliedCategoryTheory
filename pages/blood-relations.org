#+TITLE: Blood Relations
   
   Check out the diagrams about halfway through the
   [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_type][Wikipedia article on blood types]]. 
   I've (badly) reproduced the relevant ones here.
   

|           | Donor |    |    |    |    |    |     |     |
| Recipient | O-    | O+ | A− | A+ | B− | B+ | AB− | AB+ |
|-----------+-------+----+----+----+----+----+-----+-----|
| O−        | Y     | _  | _  | _  | _  | _  | _   | _   |
| O+        | Y     | Y  | _  | _  | _  | _  | _   | _   |
| A−        | Y     | _  | Y  | _  | _  | _  | _   | _   |
| A+        | Y     | Y  | Y  | Y  | _  | _  | _   | _   |
| B−        | Y     | _  | _  | _  | Y  | _  | _   | _   |
| B+        | Y     | Y  | _  | _  | Y  | Y  | _   | _   |
| AB−       | Y     | _  | Y  | _  | Y  | _  | Y   | _   |
| AB+       | Y     | Y  | Y  | Y  | Y  | Y  | Y   | Y   |

   You can derive many mappings from this article.
   There is a mapping from people to blood types.
   
   The diagrams show donor/recipient type compatibility as an order relation.
   How is this related to the mapping from people to blood types?

   Can a category be formed using blood types as objects? What would the arrows
   be?

   Is the mapping of people to blood types a monomorphism? epimorphism? iso?
   Could it be an endomorphism?
   
   Does the mapping of people to blood types induce an equivalence relation
   on the set of people?  What would be the equivalence classes?

   How would you describe compatibility as a binary relation?
   Is it
   * reflexive?  That would mean, everyone can receive their own blood type.
   * symmetric?  What would that mean?
   * antisymmetric?  What would that mean?
   * transitive? What would that mean?

   If it's an equivalence relation, what equivalence classes are induced by it?
