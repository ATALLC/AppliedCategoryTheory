#+TITLE: Blood Relations

   Check out the diagrams about halfway through the
   [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_type][Wikipedia article on blood types]].
   I've (badly) reproduced the relevant ones here.

* Mapping people to blood types

   You can derive many mappings from this article.
   For example, there is a mapping from people to blood types:
   given a person, what is their blood type?

   Is the mapping of people to blood types a monomorphism? epimorphism? iso?
   Could it be an endomorphism?

   Does the mapping of people to blood types induce an equivalence relation
   on the set of people?  What would be the equivalence classes?

* Blood compatibility as a relation

|           | Donor |    |    |    |    |    |     |     |
| Recipient | O-    | O+ | A− | A+ | B− | B+ | AB− | AB+ |
|-----------+-------+----+----+----+----+----+-----+-----|
| O−        | Y     | _  | _  | _  | _  | _  | _   | _   |
| O+        | Y     | Y  | _  | _  | _  | _  | _   | _   |
| A−        | Y     | _  | Y  | _  | _  | _  | _   | _   |
| A+        | Y     | Y  | Y  | Y  | _  | _  | _   | _   |
| B−        | Y     | _  | _  | _  | Y  | _  | _   | _   |
| B+        | Y     | Y  | _  | _  | Y  | Y  | _   | _   |
| AB−       | Y     | _  | Y  | _  | Y  | _  | Y   | _   |
| AB+       | Y     | Y  | Y  | Y  | Y  | Y  | Y   | Y   |

   The first diagram shows donor/recipient type compatibility as an order relation.
   How is this related to the mapping from people to blood types?

   Can a category be formed using blood types as objects? What would the arrows
   be?  Would you have to add any that aren't shown in the diagram?

   How would you describe compatibility as a binary relation?
   Is it
   * reflexive?  That would mean, everyone can receive their own blood type.
   * symmetric?  What would that mean?
   * antisymmetric?  What would that mean?
   * transitive? What would that mean?

   If it's an equivalence relation, what equivalence classes are induced by it?

   The article also describes the compatibility of blood plasma, shown
   in the next diagram.

   How would you describe this as a binary relation?
   Answer the same questions as for the previous diagram.

   How does this relation compare to the one for blood compatibility?
