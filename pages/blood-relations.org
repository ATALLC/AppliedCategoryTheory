#+TITLE: Blood Relations
   
   Check out the diagrams about halfway through the
   [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_type][Wikipedia article on blood types]].

   You can derive many mappings from this article.
   There is a mapping from people to blood types.
   The diagrams show donor/recipient type compatibility as a partial order.

   Can a category be formed using blood types as objects? What would the arrows
   be?

   Is the mapping of people to blood types a monomorphism? epimorphism? iso?
   Could it be an endomorphism?

   How would you describe compatibility as an equivalence relation?
   What equivalence classes are induced by it?
