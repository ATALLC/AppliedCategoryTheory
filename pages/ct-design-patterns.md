# Category Theory gives a set of universal design patterns

To this old software guy, category theory offers natural design patterns. By
"natural" I mean that they arise as reasoned consequences of assumptions. In
software, engineers have used design patterns to think about and communicate
ways to build code to solve problems.

Seasoned programmers can recognize patterns in systems code that aren't always
readily expressed by the programming languages. They're like the ghost in the
machine that you sense is there. Even languages like Haskell that try to make
the ghosts be first-class citizens can't fully reveal them.

Mark Seemann has a [Universal Design Patterns](https://seemannworkshop.netcorebcn.group/) workshop.

In the late 90s, I first encountered design patterns as applied to software
design. "Gang of Four" book.

Machine-learning researchers are applying this paper explicitly references the
"Gang of Four" book. [Modular Design Patterns for Hybrid Learning And Reasoning Systems: A Taxonomy, Patterns And Use Cases](Https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.11965.pdf).
