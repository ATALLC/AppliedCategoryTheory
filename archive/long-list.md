## Lambek pregroup grammar

The [DisCoCat](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/categorical+compositional+distributional+semantics) framework (Categorical compositional distributional semantics) "uses category theory to combine the benefits of two very different approaches to linguistics: categorial grammar and distributional semantics."

Is there a mathematical treatment of grammar that would help frame the question "Why do certain strings of words sound better, more poetic?" Does poetry sound better than prose in a language you don't understand?

Wikipedia doesn't have an entry for pregroup. Searching for it redirects to [Pregroup grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregroup_grammar), which starts with a definition of pregroup.

[Pregroup Grammar on ncatlab](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/pregroup+grammar) is a more advanced treatment.

## Category Theory

Category theory underpins mathematics, and therefore programming languages. Historically it's been presented as a unifying study of deep symmetries in mathematics in a way that's impenetrable to non-specialists. More recently it's come to the attention of a wider audience of programming language aficionados, especially in functional language communities such as Haskell and type-theorists, and formal proof systems.

[Notes on category theory with examples from basic mathematics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.10642) These notes were originally developed as lecture notes for a category theory course. They should be well-suited to anyone that wants to learn category theory from scratch and has a scientific mind. There is no need to know advanced mathematics, nor any of the disciplines where category theory is traditionally applied, such as algebraic geometry or theoretical computer science. The only knowledge that is assumed from the reader is linear algebra. All concepts are explained by giving concrete examples from different, non-specialized areas of mathematics (such as basic group theory, graph theory, and probability). Not every example is helpful for every reader, but hopefully every reader can find at least one helpful example per concept. The reader is encouraged to read all the examples, this way they may even learn something new about a different field. Particular emphasis is given to the Yoneda lemma and its significance, with both intuitive explanations, detailed proofs, and specific examples. Another common theme in these notes is the relationship between categories and directed multigraphs, which is treated in detail. From the applied point of view, this shows why categorical thinking can help whenever some process is taking place on a graph.

[Categorial Grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorial_grammar) is a term used for a family of formalisms in natural language syntax motivated by the principle of compositionality and organized according to the view that syntactic constituents should generally combine as functions or according to a function-argument relationship.

A mathematical framework for a rigorous theory of general systems is constructed, using the theory of Categories and Functors inroduced by Eilenberg and MacLane. A short discussion of the basic ideas is given, and their possible application to the theory of biological systems is discussed. On the basis of these considerations, a number of results are proved, includuing the possibility of selecting a unique representative (a "canonical form") from a family of mathematical objects, all of which represent the same system. As an example, the reprsentation of the neural net and the finit automaton is constructed in terms of our general theory.

The last two minutes of [Bartosz Milewski Category Theory 1.1](https://youtu.be/I8LbkfSSR58?t=2674) makes the point that category theory is more about epistemology (the way we think) than ontology (the way things are). Semiotics is also about epistemology.

  Of this [@sclv](https://twitter.com/sclv/status/1128939715523174400) says: The standard story is that Godel's second incompleteness theorem stopped Hilbert's program dead in its tracks, because one could not prove the consistency of PA within itself. But a lovely new paper from Artemov argues that this isn't what G2 proved at all!

  In fact, what G2 proved was simply that no **single sentence** in PA could prove the consistency of PA. Artemov shows that by means verifiable in PA, we can prove, for any given sentence in PA that it is not inconsistent, which suffices for Hilbert's goals!

  (I should add that this lovely result is very parallel to what we do in computer science, where despite the existence of the halting problem, we somehow manage to prove things about programs all the time!)

# Breakthroughs :)

Jules Hedges, \[02.10.19 07:19\] I'm proud to announce I've invented the term "yoloidal category" for a non-strict monoidal category that you pretend is strict so you can interpret string diagrams there

sg495, \[02.10.19 07:22\] What about "fomoidal categories"? They are not really monoidal, but they will pretend to be if that gets them into the party.

sg495, \[02.10.19 07:24\] (e.g. the cartesian closed categories in which you add duals and they become 2-categories but you pick both background colours to be transparent so your diagrams look like they live in a monoidal category)

Jules Hedges, \[02.10.19 07:25\] That's both fomoidal and yoloidal - you need to pretend that the product is strictly associative

Jules Hedges, \[02.10.19 07:25\] Yoloidal categories are a technical trick to avoid thinking about the Mac Lane coherence theorem 100 times a day, by pretending it doesn't exist

Jules Hedges, \[02.10.19 07:36\] Abramsky's "Arrow's theorem by arrow theory" for example <https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.4585>
