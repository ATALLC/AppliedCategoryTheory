   * [[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.05631.pdf][At the Interface of Algebra and Statistics]] ([[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiadG3ywJIs&feature=youtu.be][video]]) Tae-Danae Bradley's thesis
     on composing statistical processes. 
     This is some of the clearest, informative exposition you'll find.
