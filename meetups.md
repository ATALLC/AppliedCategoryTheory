## 🎯 How These Align with LevelUp

* **Friday deep‑dive topics** often mirror current SYCO/ACT conference papers.
* We encourage LevelUp participants to **submit lightning talks** about Wingman, DevSecOps proofs, or prompt engineering.
* Travel grants and virtual‑attendance stipends are sometimes available—ask in `#levelup‑act`.
