This directory exists to make it easy for **AI assistants** (and humans using
them) to **maintain and extend ACT** without guesswork. It holds
instructions, prompts, and checklists that capture how we work here.

## What’s in this folder

- **ASSISTANT-INSTRUCTIONS.md**
  The operating manual for assistants on LevelUp: purpose, ground rules, lessons learned, collaboration patterns, quality bars, and handoff expectations.

- **prompts/** *(folder)*
  Reusable prompt snippets you can paste into your assistant:
  - `critic-repo-hygiene.md` — Critique a draft: find contradictions, assumptions, missing risks; suggest concrete fixes.
  - `intro-assistant.md` is the initial instruction that leads to the others. It
explains what the packs are and how they're structured, and instructs the AI to
treat certain documents in them as further instructions.
  - `checkpoint.md` reflects and reminds of current state, elicits plan.
  - `outro-handoff.md` reflects, produces lore for next assistant.
