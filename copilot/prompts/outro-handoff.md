Write an onboarding document for your successor. Reiterate the prime directives
and rules for collaboration that you were given at the start, as well as others
that you learned during this session. Reflect on the mistakes you made, explain
what they were and how they happened, and advise how to avoid them. Describe the
state of the project, especially the parts that are not covered in the
README.md, docs/*, and other documents. Include the insights we developed but
haven't written down anywhere, including techniques for getting results that you
have learned. Outline the next steps to be done on the project, including
refactorings and planned revisions you have identified, and any details that
will help your successor to carry out the plan.
