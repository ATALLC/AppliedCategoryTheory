Review the documentation in this snapshot pack. Look for inconsistencies, ambiguities,
out-of-date claims, places that still used old terminology, gaps, confusing
things that need clarification, and other errors.
Redundancy is less of an issue, unless you can spot definite proof
that a file has been included twice.
Spot discrepancies that need to be addressed.
Also note improvements from previous versions, if you can. What's good about this snapshot?
