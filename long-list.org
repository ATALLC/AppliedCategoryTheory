[[https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.07519][On foundational aspects of RDF and SPARQL]] We propose a new formal framework
based on category theory which provides clear and concise formal definitions of
the main basic features of RDF and SPARQL. We propose to define the notions of
RDF graphs as well as SPARQL basic graph patterns as objects of some nested
categories. This allows one to clarify, in particular, the role of blank nodes.
Furthermore, we consider basic SPARQL CONSTRUCT and SELECT queries and formalize
their operational semantics following a novel algebraic graph transformation
approach called POIM.

** Category Theory

Category theory underpins mathematics, and therefore programming
languages. Historically it's been presented as a unifying study of deep
symmetries in mathematics in a way that's impenetrable to
non-specialists. More recently it's come to the attention of a wider
audience of programming language aficionados, especially in functional
language communities such as Haskell and type-theorists, and formal
proof systems.

Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics, Volume 20, 1958

A mathematical framework for a rigorous theory of general systems is
constructed, using the theory of Categories and Functors inroduced by Eilenberg
and MacLane. A short discussion of the basic ideas is given, and their possible
application to the theory of biological systems is discussed.  On the basis of these considerations,
a number of results are proved, includuing the possibility of selecting a unique representative (a "canonical form")
from a family of mathematical objects, all of which represent the same system.
As an example, the reprsentation of the neural net and the finit automaton is
constructed in terms of our general theory.

The last two minutes of [[https://youtu.be/I8LbkfSSR58?t=2674][Bartosz Milewski Category Theory 1.1]] makes the point
that category theory is more about epistemology (the way we think) than ontology
(the way things are).
Semiotics is also about epistemology.

* Breakthroughs :)

Jules Hedges, [02.10.19 07:19]
I'm proud to announce I've invented the term "yoloidal category" for a
non-strict monoidal category that you pretend is strict so you can interpret
string diagrams there

sg495, [02.10.19 07:22]
What about "fomoidal categories"? They are not really monoidal, but they will
pretend to be if that gets them into the party.

sg495, [02.10.19 07:24]
(e.g. the cartesian closed categories in which you add duals and they become
2-categories but you pick both background colours to be transparent so your
diagrams look like they live in a monoidal category)

Jules Hedges, [02.10.19 07:25]
That's both fomoidal and yoloidal - you need to pretend that the product is
strictly associative

Jules Hedges, [02.10.19 07:25]
Yoloidal categories are a technical trick to avoid thinking about the Mac Lane
coherence theorem 100 times a day, by pretending it doesn't exist

Jules Hedges, [02.10.19 07:36]
Abramsky's "Arrow's theorem by arrow theory" for example
https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.4585

Johannes Drever, [02.10.19 08:01]
[In reply to Jules Hedges]
William Wilson published a paper where categorical compositionality is computed
to a cognitive property called “systematicity”.
