- Do all Exercises: 1.75, 1.80, 1.85, 1.89
- Read as much as you can of Elie M. Adam's thesis [Systems, Generativity and Interactional Effects](https://www.mit.edu/~eadam/eadam_PhDThesis.pdf)

## lesson 3 assignment

- Read [Seven Sketches](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05316%0A) section 1.4: Galois Connections
- Do all Exercises:
- Read as much as you can of [The Galois Connection between Syntax and Semantics](https://www.logicmatters.net/resources/pdfs/Galois.pdf) You should be able to recognize some of the concepts now.

## Further reading

- [At the Interface of Algebra and Statistics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.05631.pdf) ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiadG3ywJIs&feature=youtu.be)) Tae-Danae Bradley's thesis on composing statistical processes. This is some of the clearest, informative exposition you'll find. The first chapter of this thesis applies much of the material covered in chapter 1 of Seven Sketches.

- The [two-capacitor paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_capacitor_paradox), which arises in simple models that neglect radiation, is an example of a generative effect.
