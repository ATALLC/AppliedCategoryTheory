## preparation

Assignment from [lesson 3](lesson-3.md), summarized here:

- Read [Seven Sketches](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05316%0A) section 1.4: Galois Connections
- Do all Exercises:
- Read as much as you can of [The Galois Connection between Syntax and Semantics](https://www.logicmatters.net/resources/pdfs/Galois.pdf) You should be able to recognize some of the concepts now.

## lesson 4 assignment

- Read [Seven Sketches](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05316%0A) section 2.1 and 2.2:

  - Getting from a to b
  - Symmetric Monoidal Preorders

- Do all Exercises:

- Read as much as you can of [A survey of graphical languages for monoidal categories](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0908.3347.pdf) Peter Selinger

- Try reading your chosen research paper again. What concepts do you understand better now?

## Relevant papers

- [A Mathematical Theory of Resources](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.5531), Coecke, Fritz, Spekkens

- [A survey of graphical languages for monoidal categories](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0908.3347.pdf) Peter Selinger

- [Evan Patterson, String Diagrams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmrDYQh4rc) video, string diagrams in catlab

- [A complete language for faceted dataflow programs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.05937.pdf) describes ETL processes, a favorite application of dataflow, which SMCs model well.
