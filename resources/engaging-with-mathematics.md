# Engaging with Math

Studying mathematics requires a certain discipline and habits. It\'s not
hard to develop these, but if you don\'t, you won\'t learn as much and
you\'ll probably get lost. Here\'s what has helped me:

-   Write stuff down! This is easy, and surprisingly effective.
-   Do the exercises. Really try. Don\'t just look at the answers.
-   Keep to a schedule. Make some time every day to do exercises.

But just don\'t take my word for it:

The [first pages of A Programmer\'s Introduction to
Mathematics](https://pimbook.org/pdf/pim_first_pages.pdf) explains that
programmers tend to have different habits than mathematicians, and has
very good advice on how to gain the discipline you need.

[How to learn math and
physics](http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/books.html) is John Baez\'s
extremely well-informed advice.

[Teach Yourself CS](https://teachyourselfcs.com/) recommends good books
and courses on not just math, but also computer architecture,
programming, and distributed systems.

## Leslie Lamport: Coding is only a small part of programming

"You don't understand something until you've written it down carefully
--- carefully enough to explain it to somebody else. And if you haven't
done that, you're just thinking you understand it," Lamport, ⁦@HLForum⁩
2019

"... Think of it this way: writing is a way of revealing how fuzzy your
thinking is. In this context, coding is just a small part of programming
where real thinking takes place."
