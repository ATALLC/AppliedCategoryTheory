## 🎲 Odds & Ends

* **Interactive adjunction explorer** — tiny Elm app that animates unit/counit triangles. (link: `gist.github.com/adjoint/abcdefg`)
* **Category‑theory sticker set** — SVGs for functor, monad, and lens icons; often used in LevelUp slide decks.
* **"Musical Monoids"** — short video showing monoids via chord progressions; great ice‑breaker clip.
